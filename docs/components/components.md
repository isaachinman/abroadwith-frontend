# Components

## Images

In the subdirectory called `img`, you will find screenshots of all of the components that the Abroadwith application uses.

### Naming

The images are named identically to how they are stored in the code - this way we can all refer to things specifically
and using the same terminology; a VerificationModule is always a VerificationModule and never anything else.

## Rendering

The application renders components via React both on a server and on the client as needed.
State is shared between the server and client environment via a single Redux store.
