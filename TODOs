// General
1. Need to change message/thread endpoint to include homeID
2. Build contact component and endpoint
3. Swap react-google-maps in homestay creation for google-map-react

// Homestay search page
- Immersion selection needs to be a central focus of the dashboard
- Integrate immersion colours more clearly
- Immersions should be visible without any clicking
- Potentially use stepped slider to explain meal options (three steps: breakfast, breakfast + dinner, all three)
---- DATE CHECK: if arrival or departure is present, make sure the other is present too before triggering search, otherwise it's useless
---- Add filters, pageSize, pageOffset into url rehydration
