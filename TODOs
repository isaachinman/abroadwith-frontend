1. Use Redux Devtools Extension to produce tests
2. Webpack long-term caching not working correctly, hash names being generate erroneously (https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/1315)
3. Refactor all actions to take an exact number of arguments, eg
    - Authorised requests: (token, data, options)
    - Unauthorised requests: (data, options)
4. The layout of the homes and users reducers are unintuitive and could use refactoring, or renaming at the least
5. Refactoring getComponents in routes/index.js
