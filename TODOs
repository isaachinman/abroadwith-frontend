// JWT
1. See about possibility of doing away with cbk by just checking it directly in the user object
2. For that matter, see about making JWT completely immutable

// SETTINGS
1. Finish payments and verifications module (probably get rid of verifications tab altogether)

// REDUX
1. Move all the various files on the top level of the redux dir into appropriate either public or private data dirs
2. Either decide on dashes or camel case and be consistent

// TRANSLATIONS
1. Forgot about /en/about sort of routes, need to figure out a way to have dynamic routing like this that also triggers a ui-language change
    -Basically should check if the first sub path, eg between first '/' and second '/' matches a valid locale
    -If it does, just change to that locale and keep the route the same
    -Also need to look into then keeping this '/en/' prefix in front of links the user goes to from there
