1. Need to change message/thread endpoint to include homeID
2. Document each redux action with the exact API endpoint it contacts (via swagger url)
3. Build contact component and endpoint

// Homestay search page
1. Immersion selection needs to be a central focus of the dashboard
  - Integrate immersion colours more clearly
  - Immersions should be visible without any clicking
  - Remove "Add a language course" toggle, upsell will take its place
  - Potentially use stepped slider to explain meal options (three steps: breakfast, breakfast + dinner, all three)
