// Manage Home

1. Need to change message/thread endpoint to include homeID
2. Document each redux action with the exact API endpoint it contacts (via swaggger url)
3. Build contact component and endpoint
4. Replace Radium with react-css-modules

// Homestay search page
1. Immersion selection needs to be a central focus of the dashboard
  - Integrate immersion colours more clearly
  - Immersions should be visible without any clicking
  - Remove "Add a language course" toggle, upsell will take its place
  - Potentially use stepped slider to explain meal options (three steps: breakfast, breakfast + dinner, all three)
