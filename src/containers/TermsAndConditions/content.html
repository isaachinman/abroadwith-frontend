<h3>2. Binding Agreement</h3>

These services are booked directly by the students from the immersion hosts and educators on the platform. We act as the interface between the immersion hosts, educators and students.</p>
<p>Students enter into a contract, when they send an immersion booking request. Immersion hosts and educators enter into a contract, when they confirm a booking request. The terms, conditions and obligations of this contract are specified below:</p>
<p>The student discloses what kind of immersion option he/she is requesting, including the duration of the immersion, the type of immersion program, details concerning the immersion option and services requested at home to the immersion host. The student must abide by the price disclosed publicly set forth by the immersion host, as well as Abroadwith&rsquo;s Service fee.</p>
<p>Additionally, the student may book a language course from a language school or a language tutor (educators) in proximity to their host's home. In this case, the student lets the educator know what kind of language course option he/she is requesting, including the duration of the course, course schedule and level. The student must abide by the price disclosed publicly by the educators, as well as Abroadwith's fees.</p>
<p>The contract between students and immersion host does not go into effect, if the immersion hosts denies the request during the confirmation period, which is within the first 48 hours after a booking request is made.
