  <h5>Why become an immersion host with Abroadwith?</h5>

    <p>
      If you have been hosting international students in your home you already know first hand how rewarding it can be to share your language and culture. Considering you were likely connected with your student through an intermediary, you probably never had complete control in the process of choosing who ultimately shows up at your door for their studies abroad You really never knew for sure, if the student would truly be a good fit.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, with Abroadwith, the decision-making power is yours. You decide it all; from how many and what meals you cook to how much you charge and spend with your student outside of the home. Through our user-friendly platform, you choose exactly who comes to live in your home. Below are just some of the benefits in hosting with Abroadwith:

      <strong>Stay:</strong> in this traditional homestay program, share your home with foreign language students, helping them immerse in your local community. Students live in your home as if they were another member of the family or roommate. That said, it will be expected that they take part in the daily home activities. Immersion hosts should encourage the student to speak the local language as often as possible.

      <strong>Tandem:</strong> what if instead of going abroad to learn a language you could bring that language into your own home? This is the idea behind tandem: share your home with foreign language students and learn their language in exchange. In this immersion program students and hosts split time between learning both tandem languages. Choose what languages you are interested in learning in your home profile. Both students and hosts are encouraged to take initiative in communicating as much as possible in the dual languages, correcting each other when needed. This will help improve language skills immensely, and make the immersion program a success for both parties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please keep in mind that if you are offering Stay or Teacherâ€™s Stay immersion programs, Tandem must be the most affordable option.

      <strong>Teacher's stay:</strong> if you are a qualified teacher, you can start teaching foreign language students in the comfort of your own home. Beyond just tutoring, teachers are expected to welcome the students as if they were a member of the family or roommate. Conversing with the students often and encouraging them to speak in the local language is important in every immersion program. Being a teacher in this immersion program means you go the extra mile, taking responsibility in making a successful language experience for the student.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this program, as a teacher you choose how many hours a week you want to teach. Decide your hourly rate and prepare your lessons. In order to qualify for this program, teachers must provide Abroadwith with enough evidence of his/her teaching certifications and experience.
