      <strong>Stay:</strong> in this traditional homestay program, share your home with foreign language students and make them part of your community. Students live at home like another member of the family or the student apartment taking part in the daily life and activities at home. Immersion hosts should welcome the students at home and encourage them to speak the local language as often as possible.

      <strong>Tandem:</strong> what if instead of going abroad to learn a language you could bring that language home?This is the main idea behind tandem, share your home with foreign language students and learn a language with them. In this immersion program students and hosts split the amount of hours learning between each tandem language. Choose what languages are you interested in learning on your home admin and start learning. Both students and hosts are encouraged to take initiative in communicating as much as possible and correct each other to help improve language skills and make the immersion program a success for everyone.
