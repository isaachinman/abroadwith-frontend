      Students going abroad to learn languages often find a complicated and slow process with little say on where to stay, finding offering for languages out of the mainstream languages or a more authentic experience in smaller towns or cities offering a different or more traditional lifestyle. At abroadwith we want to change this and move control and decision making goes in the process from intermediates directly to immersion hosts and students. We want language students from around the world to connect with likeminded people with similar personal interests, lifestyle and passion for languages.
