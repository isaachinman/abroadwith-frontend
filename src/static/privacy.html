    <h5>2. Privacy policy</h5>
    <p>This Privacy Policy (hereinafter: &ldquo;Policy&rdquo;) describes how Abroadwith UG (hereinafter: &ldquo;We,&rdquo; &ldquo;Our,&rdquo; , &ldquo;Abroadwith&rdquo; or &ldquo;our website&rdquo;) handles our users&rsquo; (hereinafter: &ldquo;you,&rdquo;
      &ldquo;your&rdquo;) personal information on Abroadwith.com and in our system and services (together, the &ldquo;Service&rdquo;).</p>

    <p>Abroadwith considers the protection and confidentiality of your data to be very important. Your personal data will be collected and used solely within the statutory provisions of the applicable data protection laws namely, Bundesdatenschutzgesetz
      (Federal Data Protection Act - BDSG). Our Data Protection Declaration explains what personal information is collected from users of Abroadwith, and how it is used. It also explains how you can ask questions, make suggestions, and complain about
      our privacy practices.</p>

    <p>Our goal in collecting information is to provide and improve our services and content, to administer your Membership and to enable users to enjoy and easily navigate our Website. </p>

    <p>Your use of our website and services is subject to this policy in effect at the time of your use. By accepting our Privacy Policy and our Terms and Conditions, you expressly consent to our collection, storage, disclosure and use of your personal information
      as described in this Policy. Abroadwith reserves the right to update and modify this policy from time to time without previous notice or acceptance by you, so please check this page frequently for any updates and changes. However, changes made to
      this Policy will not apply to you when: (1) the changes concern matters which are the subject of a current dispute between you and Abroadwith as of the date the changes take effect and (2) Abroadwith has actual notice of the dispute as of the date
      when changes take effect.</p>

    <p>In this Policy we will inform you of the type, scope and purpose of the collection and use of personal data. You may access this information at Abroadwith.com at any time.</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control or to people that we do not employ or manage. By submitting your personal information to Abroadwith, and by visiting Abroadwith, you signify your agreement
      to all clauses on this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h5>3. Subject matter of data protection</h5>
    <p>
      The subject matter of the data protection is personal data. As defined in sec. 3 (1) of the German Bundesdatenschutzgesetz (Federal Data Protection Act - BDSG), this consists of individual information on personal or objective circumstances of a specific
      or identifiable natural person. This includes information such as your correct name, your postal address, your e-mail address, your telephone number, and usage data.
    </p>
  </div>

<div id='4' class='row left-align'>
  <div class='col s12 m10 offset-m1 l10 offset-l1'>
    <h5>4. Collection and use of data</h5>
    <p>What is personal information?</p>

    <p>Personal information is any piece of information that relates to a living, identifiable human being.</p>

    <p>Whenever you visit Abroadwith.com, whether as a registered user or a non-registered user just browsing, our servers automatically record information that your browser or mobile phone sends when you visit a website (&ldquo;Log Data&rdquo;). Log Data
      may include information such as your Internet Protocol address (&ldquo;IP&rdquo;), phone operating system and model, browser type or the webpage you were visiting before you came to our website, pages or sections of our Services that you browse
      or click on, the information you search for on the Service, the time spent on each of those pages, login times, dates and other statistics. </p>

    <p>Abroadwith uses this information to monitor and analyse the use of the Service by the user, for technical administration, to increase our website&rsquo;s functionality and its ease of use to better tailor our services to your needs, and improve your
      experience. We also use this information to verify that users meet the criteria required to process their requests. Abroadwith does not treat Log Data as personal information or use it in association with other personal information, though we may
      aggregate, analyse and evaluate such information for the same purposes as stated above regarding other non-identifying information.</p>
  </div>

<div id='5' class='row left-align'>
  <div class='col s12 m10 offset-m1 l10 offset-l1'>
    <h5>5. User data</h5>
    <p>You do not need to provide us with any personal data in order to visit the Website. However, certain Services do require that you register for an Abroadwith account and, by doing so, you will provide us with certain information, including but not
      limited to: your correct name, your postal address, your e-mail address, your telephone number, personal interests, languages and data usage. When registering on our services through social media accounts (Facebook or Google+) you authorise access
      through Facebook Connect and Google+. By connecting to our website with Facebook and Google+, you give us permission to access, store and use your information from Facebook and/or Google+ including, but not limited to, your User ID, any information
      that you have permitted Facebook or Google+ to share with us and any information you have made public in connection with that service (&ldquo;Personal Information&rdquo;).</p>

    <p>Information from Facebook and Google+ is provided to us under the terms of Facebook&rsquo;s and Google+&rsquo;s privacy policy. You can control the information that we receive from Google+ and Facebook using the privacy settings in your Facebook and
      Google+ account.</p>

    <p>We also collect the other information that you provide as part of registration and the administration and personalisation of your profile (e.g., topics and interests) (&ldquo;Non-Identifying Information&rdquo;). </p>

    <p>Abroadwith also collects credit card, Paypal and other payment information as needed to process payments for services. We do not permanently store your credit card information. Third parties will, however, store your credit card information in order
      to process your booking request, as specified on point 9, Service Providers . If you are a host we will store payout information (bank account information and/or Paypal) in order to transfer your income generated from services provided.&#8232; We
      use your Personal Information (in some cases, in conjunction with your Non-Identifying Information) mainly to provide the Service, complete your transactions, and administer your inquiries. We will share part of this personal information (name,
      contact information and details on the booking) with language immersions hosts, language tutors and language schools after you decide to book/receive their services.</p>

    <p>Certain Non-Identifying Information would be considered a part of your Personal Information, if it were combined with other information in a way that enables you to be identified. But the same pieces of information are considered Non-Identifying Information,
      when they are taken alone or combined only with other non-identifying information (for example, your viewing preferences). We may combine your Personal Information with Non-Identifying Information and aggregate it with information collected from
      other users of the Service to attempt to provide you with a better experience, to improve the quality and value of the Service and to analyse and understand how our Service is used. We may also use the combined information without aggregating it
      to serve you specifically, for instance, to deliver a product to you according to your preferences or restrictions.</p>

    <p>We may directly collect analytics data, or use third-party analytics tools, e.g. from Google Analytics, Crashlytics, Facebook Insights and others, to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These tools collect information sent by
      your browser that assists us in improving the Service. We collect and use this analytics information in aggregate form such that it cannot reasonably be manipulated to identify any particular individual user.</p>

    <p>To opt-out of being tracked by Google Analytics on the Website and other websites, please visithttp://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.</p>

    <p>We also use your Personal Information to contact you with updates, service messages, newsletter-marketing and other information that may be of interest to you. You may opt out of commercial promotion notifications on your account admin. </p>
