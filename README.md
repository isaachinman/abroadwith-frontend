# Abroadwith

_NB: Several steps have been taking to strip functionality from this application so that it can run as a simple demo on a Heroku dyno. This company is now dissolved, and this product is no longer maintained._

This is the main Abroadwith frontend application, and contains NodeJs server(s), Express
endpoints, isomorphic rendering of UI via ReactJs, etc.

For more information, look within the top-level `docs` directory.
