  "why_become": "Why become an immersion host with Abroadwith?",
  "why_become_paragraph0": "Homestays are on the rise, and taking place all over the world. More and more students studying abroad are choosing a homestay over living in student dorms or university apartments for several reasons. For one, with homestay the student has an immediate support system with their new found host family. Many families sending their loved ones abroad, feel more comfortable doing so for this very reason. Secondly, it’s a way to fully immerse in the culture where they decide to pursue their studies abroad. And finally, a homestay abroad is one of the best ways to learn and improve a foreign language.",
  "why_become_paragraph1": "If you’ve been dedicating your home as a homestay in order to host international students, you already know first hand how rewarding it can be. Considering that you were likely connected with your international student through an intermediary,  you probably never had complete control in the process of choosing who ultimately showed up at your door for their studies abroad.",
  "why_become_paragraph2": "Abroadwith gives host families like yourself complete control in deciding it all; from how many and what meals you cook, to how much you charge. Through our user-friendly platform, you choose exactly who comes to live in your home. Below are just some of the benefits in hosting international students with Abroadwith:",
  "why_become_bullet1": "Choose when it is <strong>the best time for you to host, and who to host.</strong>",
  "why_become_bullet2": "Choose from <strong>three different immersion programs.</strong>",
  "why_become_bullet3": "<strong>Connect with like-minded people.</strong> Customize your profile in order to connect with students with similar personal interests.",
  "why_become_bullet4": "<strong>Supplement your income.</strong> Charge what you deem fair based on your location, costs of living, and services you offer.",
  "why_become_bullet5": "<strong>Share your language and culture.</strong> Learn from far away cultures and languages of your interest.",
  "why_become_bullet6": "<strong>Free registration</strong> and use of the Abroadwith platform.",
  "why_become_bullet7": "Open to families, shared apartments, and teachers.",
  "immersions": "Immersion programs",
  "immersions_paragraph": "We have three variations of homestays. In fact, we call homestays “immersion programs.” Below we'll explain in detail the differences. As an individual host or host family for any of the programs, you are expected to make your international students feel welcome and at home. All three of our immersion programs include breakfast, and a minimum of seven hours per week spent with the students to help immerse them in the local culture and language.",
  "stay_paragraph": "In this traditional homestay program, share your home with foreign language students, helping them immerse in your local community. Students live in your home as if they were another member of the family or roommate. That said, it will be expected that they take part in the daily home activities. Immersion hosts should encourage the student to speak the local language as often as possible.",
  "tandem_paragraph1": "What if instead of going abroad to learn a language you could bring that language into your own home? This is the idea behind tandem: share your home with foreign language students and learn their language in exchange. In this immersion program students and hosts split time between learning both tandem languages. Choose what languages you are interested in learning in your home profile. Both students and hosts are encouraged to take initiative in communicating as much as possible in the dual languages, correcting each other when needed. This will help improve language skills immensely, and make the immersion programme a success for both parties.",
  "tandem_paragraph2": "Please keep in mind that if you are offering Stay or Teacher’s Stay immersion programs, Tandem must be the most affordable option.",
  "teacher_paragraph1": "If you are a qualified teacher, you can start teaching foreign language students in the comfort of your own home. Beyond just tutoring, teachers are expected to welcome the students as if they were a member of the family or roommate. Conversing with the students often and encouraging them to speak in the local language is important in every immersion program. Being a teacher in this immersion program means you go the extra mile, taking responsibility in making a successful language experience for the student.",
  "teacher_paragraph2": "In this program, as a teacher you choose how many hours a week you want to teach. Decide your hourly rate and prepare your lessons. In order to qualify for this program, teachers must provide Abroadwith with enough evidence of his or her teaching certifications and experience.",
