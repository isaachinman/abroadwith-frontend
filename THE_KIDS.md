Feedback from TheKids

1) On signup, it is confusing to users that are learning English and also "know" English
  -Change copy to be more clear, eg "Languages you speak _fluently_"

2) Change "Arrival/Departure" to "Check-In/Check-out"

3) Need in-depth explanation of immersion types on search page itself

4) Consider adding room-availability calendars on the home profile
  -Would need to make room availability calendars public

5) Potential bug of "Room unavailable for selected dates"

6) Consider moving message to host into first step of booking process

7) Do not show upsell step if there are no upsell options available (course search returns zero)

8) Couldn't add Dutch credit card to Braintree client drop-in UI

9) Consider setting up email campaigns (workflows) for users who did not convert on the upsell
  -Send an email one week after purchase for upsell resell-value
  -Consider offering discount code on upsell reoffer

10) Consider adding "Featured stays" to homestay landing page, and "Featured courses" to course landing page
  -Look at AirBnb for examples

11) Look at Lianne's PDF for home profile page layout, adopt AirBnb style price/datepicker with room picker inline as well
  -Consider keeping this price/datepicker sticky on desktop

12) Look at navbar from Lianne's PDF, has "Homestay" and "Courses"

13) Consider that a map on course search page may not be necessary

14) Consider building educator profile page the same as homestay profile page, but with "Course" dropdown instead of rooms

15) Look at Lianne's PDF for "Diet wishes" -- toggles to hide more complex UI in booking process that not all users will need

16) Stickied final overview in all steps of booking process

17) Consider not including homestay upsell in course booking and just adding to an email list for initial 2.0 launch
