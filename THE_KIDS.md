6) Consider moving message to host into first step of booking process

9) Consider setting up email campaigns (workflows) for users who did not convert on the upsell
  -Send an email one week after purchase for upsell resell-value
  -Consider offering discount code on upsell reoffer

12) Look at navbar from Lianne's PDF, has "Homestay" and "Courses"

14) Consider building educator profile page the same as homestay profile page, but with "Course" dropdown instead of rooms

17) Consider not including homestay upsell in course booking and just adding to an email list for initial 2.0 launch
